# SMTP-java

An SMTP email protocol coded using java.
The SMTP follows a TCP protocol where the client sends "SYN" flags to the server which replies with "ACK" Flags.
The Server java file must be run first before running the Client java file.
We can get a transcript of the communications between the Server and the Client using Wireshark.
